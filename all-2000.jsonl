Until the software upgrade is available, Baxter recommended that the accounts notify healthcare providers of the potential for an overinfusion condition in Intermittent mode if the above sequence is performed during an infusion, and to utilize the Lockout mode after programming the pump.  Any questions were directed to Baxter''s Medication Delivery Services at 1-800-843-7867.\n\nThe letter also informed the accounts of two patient deaths due to medication delivery errors resulting from improper programming of the infusion parameters into the 6060 and 6060E pumps, and reports where the infusion parameters were modified by untrained individuals, which may result in overinfusion or underinfusion conditions.  The letter stressed that programming of the pump must be performed only by trained clinicians, or healthcare providers trained and deemed competent by trained clinicians or under the direct supervision of trained clinicians; the Lockout mode feature of the pump should be used to prevent unauthorized changes to the pump programming; and the pump security codes, which disable the Lockout mode, must not be released to anyone other than trained healthcare professionals.

The letters informed the healthcare providers that Teleflex has been made aware of incidents in which the ligating clips (sizes L and XL) were reported to have become dislodged following ligation of the renal artery after laparoscopic donor nephrectomy.  Although none of the incidents appear to have involved any defect in or malfunction of the ligating clips, misapplication of the Hem-o-lok clips during such laparascopic procedures may not immediately be apparent and can have serious, even life-threatening consequences post-operatively.  Therefore, Teleflex has added the following contraindication to the Instructions for Use accompanying the Hem-o-lok Polymer Ligating Clips: 'Contraindications': Hem-o-lok ligating clips are contraindicated for use in ligating the renal artery during laparoscopic nephrectomies in living donor patients.   'Caution':  The clip must be latched to ensure proper ligation of the vessel or tissue.  Inspect the ligation site after application to ensure proper closure of the clip.  Security of the closure should be confirmed after ligation.  The Hem-o-lok Polymer Ligating Clip is not designed for use as a tissue marker.  Weck recommends that more than one clip be used to ligate the renal artery in procedures other than laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (see Contraindication, above).  Application of more than one clip to all other vessels should be left to the surgeon's judgment.'

Consignees are instructed to check their inventory to verify whether their serial numbers fall within the range of pumps being recalled.  Due to possible bearing failure, SIGMA is taking the precautionary measure of servicing or replacing all affected Spectrum Infusion Pumps and is requiring the return of the recalled devices to its facility.  SIGMA has provided the following instructions for users: (1) Do not use the affected Spectrum Infusion Pumps on patient populations where inaccurate flow, ranging from back flow to over-infusion, including free flow, could result in serious adverse health consequences or death.  (2) Do not use on neonatal patients. -- If the user facility has no acceptable alternative methods for delivering therapy, the user should weigh the risks and benefits for the continued use of the affected pumps.  If you must use these pumps, SIGMA recommends the following actions which may mitigate the risk. (1) for pediatric and adult patients, an add-on Buretrol may limit the amount of an over-infusion if the failure occurs. Always follow the Buretrol manufacturer's instructions. (2) consider using air-eliminating filters. Under free flow conditions pumps cannot stop fluid flow.  If air is in the line with fluid, the air will also infuse. (3) Frequently observe that the drip rate (mL\/hr) compares to the programmed pump flow rate.  Also, make an observation of the container volume to make sure it is correct.
